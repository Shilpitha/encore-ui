    <h3> Basics </h3>

    <p>
        While buttons in EncoreUI can be marked up multiple ways: through
        <code>button</code>, <code>input type="button"</code> or
        <a href="#/components/rxButton">the rxButton directive</a>, which adds
        dynamic actions to loading indicators and messages - they should be
        styled using the <code>.button</code> class.
    </p>


    <h3> Button Sizing</h3>
    <p>
        Buttons are sized using xl, lg, sm and xs classes. Not adding the
        additional class defaults the size to medium.
    </p>

    <h3> Button Types & Using Color </h3>
    <p>
        <span class="msg-info">ENCORE-SPECIFIC:</span> in the context of the EncoreUI,
        when is a button blue and when is a green?

        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                If the form you are submitting results in CREATING or ADDING something, use green.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the form you are submitting is within a modal, use green.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the form you are submitting results in EDITING something or something
                auxillary like getting metadata from a different sources), keep it blue.
             </li>
            <li>
                If you are providing a button for the user to continue through
                a series of modals (with no submit), use blue.
             </li>
            <li>
                If you are providing a button for the user to exit a series of
                modals where no other action is required by the user, use the
                "Finish & Close" button with a blue outline.
             </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3> Button with Animation </h3>
    <p>
        The Framework provides a spinner style for use with buttons. Note that different
        spinner styles are used when content is loading or being fetched
        (see Using Colors and Icons With Links demo)
    </p>
    <p>
        When a user takes an action with results that cannot be immediately displayed,
        a spinner shown on a disabled button state until the call completes or the results
        of the user's action can be displayed in the UI. Text for buttons with spinners
        should describe the action being taken using "-ing" verbs, so the user understands
        why the button appearance has changed. Note that the disabled state ensures the user
        cannot submit the same data multiple times while the inital action completes.
    </p>
    <rx-styleguide code-url="styles/buttons/animation.html"></rx-styleguide>

    <h3> Button Groups </h3>
    <p>
        This control should NOT be used as a replacement for radio inputs. Instead, it should
        be used to indicate state on a page. For example, the legend of a time plot may allow
        the user to select a range of week, month, or year. In this situation, there is no form
        being submitted, but there is an indication of the graph's state that can be interacted with.
        Conversely, radio inputs are the correct way to implement a form input where one of a few
        options can be selected.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, this type of control should only be used with at most four segments.
    </p>

    <h2> Action Links </h2>

    <h3> Action Link Icons </h3>
    <p>
        We use the <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>
        library as a way to visualize and distinguish actionable items. So far we've tried
        to ensure that iconography with action links remains unique to one action
        (with the exception of "create", "delete", "change", "edit", and "go to" actions,
        which use the same icons in many places regedless of context). However, in the case
        of two opposite actions that you can take on a single unit (for example, choosing to
        enable connection throttling on a load balancer when throttling is disabled, or disabling
        throttling when throttling is enabled), then the same icon and color can be used. In the
        case of opposite actions, only one action should display at a time, depending on the state.
        Note that any "enable" or "disable" actions should be yellow in color, as they're causing
        changes to something rather than creating something new (green) or destroying something (red).
    </p>
    <p>
        For the majority of Encore, actionable links are used in two places -- in the upper
        right hand section of a details page, flushed right with the page-actions and
        actions-area classes, or in the rxActionMenu directive.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below we have included icons that have been used throughout Encore, as well as
        the actions associated with the icons. Please use as a reference for which icons
        are already in use and should not be duplicated.
    </p>
    <p>
        HEADS UP: Most icons have been chosen based on the verb (Add ,Edit, Delete, Restart, etc)
        but there are a couple of icons chosen on the noun (consoles, tachometers for throttling).
        This is a design pattern discrepancy that will need to be resolved in a future iteration.

    <h2> Action Link Colors </h2>
    <p>
        Status Classes are used to provide a clearer status regarding a simple message.
        Within the context of Encore, we use the following colors to convey action links:
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                Green (<code>.msg-action</code>) is for create/add actions. When part
                of a list, they appear at the top.
            </li>
            <li>
                Blue (<code>.msg-info-blue</code>) is for download actions. When part
                of a list, they appear second.
            </li>
            <li>
                Orange (<code>.msg-info</code>) is for edit/modify actions. When part
                of a list, they appear third.
            </li>
            <li>
                Red (<code>.msg-warn</code>) is for destructive actions. When part
                of a list, they appear last.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <rx-styleguide code-url="styles/buttons/action-link-colors.html"></rx-styleguide>

    <h2> Using Spinners with Action Links </h2>
    <p>
        The Framework provides a spinner style for use with action links. Note that
        different spinner styles are used when a user takes action by clicking a button
        (see <a href="#">Buttons & Links demo</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
        When an action link must first fetch data or determine state before the user
        can click it, a spinner is shown to the right of the action link, and both
        spinner and link have a disabled grey color and are not clickable.
    </p>
    <p>
        HEADS UP: Note that the spinner with action
        link is being styled on a per-project basis currently, since the current
        implementation of rxSpinner needs to be updated to support this use case
        more easily.
