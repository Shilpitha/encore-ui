                For the most part, Rackspace developer teams will be creating
                mark-up using the
                <a href="#/components/rxApp">rxPage subdirective of rxApp</a>
                as a container.

                </a>
                has a breadcrumb component, an attribute to pre-fill titles
                and subtitles, and a rxNotification container so you can send
                page-level communication errors and validation messages.
                You'll find implementation examples in angular.js code.

    <h3 id="flexbox-grid">Flexbox Grid</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>
          EncoreUI includes a grid system forked from
          <a target="_blank" href="https://material.angularjs.org/#/layout/container">
            Angular Material's layout module
          </a>. With minor usability enhancements, EncoreUI provides an
          assortment of attribute-based layout options, based on the flexbox
          layout model. Included are intuitive attribute based styles for
          responsive row and/or column based page layouts. Visit the
          <a href="#/components/layout">layout</a> section for info on how to
          use these attributes.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="date-formatting">Date formatting</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Dates in any context should be formatted this way:
          <code>Mar 2, 2015 @ 15:40 (UTC-0600)</code> &mdash; a three-letter
          capitalized month abbreviation (no period), followed by the day of
          the month (no leading zeroes), a comma, the four-digit year, an
          @ symbol, military time, and UTC in parentheses.
        </li>
        <li>
          The only time this formatting standard would not be used is when
          relative dates would be helpful to the user, such as "4 hours ago"
          or "1 week ago".
        </li>
        <li>
          It is recommended that relative dates be reserved for more informal
          settings like user notes or comments. Relative dates should not
          extend too far into the past. For instance, "1 week ago" may be
          helpful to the user, but "8 months ago" or "3 years ago" is better
          represented by the non-relative format detailed above, as it reveals
          more specific information about dates that provide better context and
          information to the user when comparing dates and times.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="helper-classes">Helper Classes</h2>
    <div class="component-description clear">
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
              To make text less prominent, change its color using the
              <code>.subdued</code> class. This change will still persist if
              the class is within a link.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can mark content as full width. For example, styling a full
              width button by using the <code>.full-width</code> class.
              This class requires 'display' to be styled as inline-block or
              block.
            </li>

                      To hide an element but not remove it from the page
                      spacing, use the <code>.hidden</code> class.

            <li>
              There are two states for progress bars: active and complete.
              Active progress bars have animated stripes, which are produced
              by the class <code>.active</code>. Full progress bars do not
              have this class, and are solid and static in appearance.</li>
            <li>
              Several options for displaying text with a progress bar are
              available: no text, a percentage (not italicized), and detailed
              text (italicized). Always try to show a percentage. Your focus
              should be to enter specific text, since it reveals both numeric
              progress and provides context for what progress is being tracked.
              See demo below.
