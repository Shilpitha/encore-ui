<p>This component is simply a reference guide to using
<a href="http://chieffancypants.github.io/angular-hotkeys/">the angular-hotkeys plugin</a>
from within EncoreUI.</p>
<p>Angular-hotkeys was chosen as the solution for hotkeys from within EncoreUI apps,
due to its integration into Angular, it&#39;s use of the very good &#39;mousetrap&#39; library,
and because it allows multiple ways to define hotkeys (through a directive, controller,
route config, etc).</p>
<h3 id="hotkeys-component_global-shortcuts">Global Shortcuts</h3>
<p>Currently there is only one global shortcut key defined (<code>h</code>). This will collapse/expand
the main menu on any page. More keys can be added as need for them is identified
(suggestions welcome!).</p>
<h3 id="hotkeys-component_shortcut-keys">Shortcut Keys</h3>
<p>Because browsers and operating systems have a long list of defined shortcut keys,
it can be difficult to find a keybinding that isn&#39;t already taken. When choosing a
shortcut key for your app, you can avoid most conflicts by simple leaving off the
modifier key (e.g. <code>ctrl</code>).</p>
<p>For Encore, the best practice is to use a single letter for your keystroke. For example,
the global key to show/hide the rxApp menu is simply <code>h</code>.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ll be defining multiple shortcuts related to a specific set of actions, consider
a combination of two letters, where the first letter is the same for all keystrokes. For
example, an account menu might have the following shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a</code> <code>n</code> Creates a new account</li>
<li><code>a</code> <code>v</code> Views the selected account</li>
<li><code>a</code> <code>d</code> Deletes the selected account</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hotkeys-component_identifying-shortcut-keys">Identifying shortcut keys</h3>
<p>If you provide a description, the shortcut will be defined in a helper list provided
when the user presses the <code>?</code> key. Currently there is no official guidance on a design
pattern to identify to end-users what particular shortcuts are outside of the standard
help window.</p>
