<rx-page title="'Links'">
  <h3 class="clear">Action Link Icons</h3>
  <p>
    To visualize and distinguish actionable items, you can use the included
    <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">
      Font Awesome
    </a>
    library. Iconography with action links remains unique to one action (with
    the exception of "create", "delete", "change", "edit", and "go to" actions,
    which use the same icons in many places regardless of context). However, in
    the case of two opposite actions that you can take on a single unit (for
    example, choosing to enable connection throttling on a load balancer when
    throttling is disabled, or disabling throttling when throttling is enabled),
    then the same icon and color can be used. In the case of opposite actions,
    only one action should display at a time, depending on the state. Any
    "enable" or "disable" actions should be yellow in color, as they're causing
    changes to something rather than creating something new (green) or
    destroying something (red).
  </p>
  <p>
    For the majority of Encore, actionable links are used in two places &mdash;
    in the upper right hand section of a details page, flushed right with the
    page-actions and actions-area classes, or in the rxActionMenu directive.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following icons have been used throughout Encore, as well as the actions
    associated with the icons. Use this as a reference for which icons are
    already in use and should not be duplicated.
  </p>
  <p>
    HEADS UP: Most icons have been chosen based on the verb (Add ,Edit, Delete,
    Restart, etc) but there are a couple of icons chosen on the noun (consoles,
    tachometers for throttling). This is a design pattern discrepancy that will
    need to be resolved in a future iteration.

  <h2>Action Link Colors</h2>
  <p>
    Status Classes are used to provide a clearer status regarding a simple
    message. Within the context of Encore, the following colors are used
    to convey action links:
  </p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>
      Green (<code>.msg-action</code>) is for create/add actions.
      When part of a list, they appear at the top.
    </li>
    <li>
      Blue (<code>.msg-info-blue</code>) is for download actions.
      When part of a list, they appear second.
    </li>
    <li>
      Orange (<code>.msg-info</code>) is for edit/modify actions.
      When part of a list, they appear third.
    </li>
    <li>
      Red (<code>.msg-warn</code>) is for destructive actions.
      When part of a list, they appear last.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Using Spinners with Action Links</h2>
  <p>
    You can use a spinner style for action links. Different spinner styles are
    available when a user takes action by clicking a button
    (see <a href="#">Buttons &amp; Links demo</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    When an action link must first fetch data or determine state before the user
    can click it, a spinner is shown to the right of the action link, and both
    spinner and link have a disabled gray color and are not clickable.
  </p>
  <p>
    HEADS UP: The spinner with action link is being styled on a per-project
    basis currently, since the current implementation of rxSpinner needs to be
    updated to support this use case more easily.
